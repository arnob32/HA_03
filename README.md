## 🧳✈️ Airport Smart Luggage Management System

### An intelligent system to track, manage, and secure passenger luggage throughout the airport journey—from check-in to claim.
This project demonstrates advanced Exception Handling and Unit Testing concepts in Java within a real-world use case.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The Airport Smart Luggage Management System is designed to make luggage handling faster, safer, and smarter at airports.
It uses modern technologies to monitor every bag’s journey — from check-in to loading, flight transfer, and baggage claim — while handling unexpected system or data errors gracefully.

This project also focuses on robust exception handling and comprehensive unit testing as part of a Java Capstone assignment.


## 🎯 Main Objectives
✅ Ensure accurate luggage tracking using RFID and database records.

✅ Prevent luggage loss by maintaining real-time status and alerts.

✅ Handle system errors gracefully (missing files, invalid data, device issues).
